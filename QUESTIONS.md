## Crossbow - Are weaknesses applied to the damage to afk hermits (so 30dmg instead of 10?) If so if both active or afk hermit are weak do both receive extra 20dmg?

## When I kill myself using TNT attack (or thorns/wolf), should I pick new active hermit this turn or wait for the next one?

## Does game end (from not having any cards in your pile) even when you use effect cards to draw more cards or only at end of a turn?

## When Mending is used, does the single use card return to end of players deck or at random spot?

## Does Mending work only when attached to active hermit, or even when it is attached to an afk hermit?

## Does chorus fruit/Cub overwrite curse of binding?

## Does chorus fruit/Cub overwrite knockback?

## Does Grian's borrow steal gold_armor/shield before attack, or is it destroyed before he can steal it?

## When scar uses shis deathloop ability and also holds a totem, should the totem be removed or stay when knocked out?

## Zedaph's ability - does the self damage also include damage to afk hermits (e.g. from bow/crossbow)

## Zedaph's ability - does the self damage include both the 20 & 60 from TNT attack?
