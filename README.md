## Node.js

Use Node.js 16-18 (19+ is not supported).

If you don't have Node.js yet we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## How to host Hermitcraft TCG

```sh
npm ci          # install packages
npm run build   # build the client
npm run server  # start the sever
```

_Please use `npm ci` instead of instead of `npm install` to avoid unneccesary changes in package-lock.json._

# Running in your development environment

```sh
npm ci               # install packges
npm run server:dev   # start the server and update automatically when you make changes
npm run client:dev   # start the client and update automatically when you make changes
npm run dev          # start both the client and server
```

By default, the client is hosted on port 3002.

## Configuration

Your instance can be configured using the `common/config/server-config.json` file.

You can also configure debug settings using `common/config/debug-config.json`. To create it, copy `common/config/debug-config.example.json` and rename it. On linux you can run `cp ./common/config/debug-config.example.json ./common/config/debug-config.json`, and on windows you can run `copy ./common/config/debug-config.example.json ./common/config/debug-config.json` to create the file.

### Formatting & coding style

We run lint/prettier/tsc as part of the PR process. We also recommend to run prettier on save in your editor, this is an example configuration using the prettier extension for VSCode:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
	"[json][jsonc]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
		"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	},
	"[javascript][typescript][typescriptreact]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
		"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	},
	"[css][scss]": {
		"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
		"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	},
	"typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
}
```
