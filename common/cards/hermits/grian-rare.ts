// The tricky part about this one are destroyable items (shield, totem, loyalty) since they are available at the moment of attack, but not after

/*
Some assumptions that make sense to me:
- Shield can't be stolen as they get used up during the attack
- If hermitMultiplier is 0 (e.g. invis potion), then shield don't get used and so you can steal it
- Totem/Loyalty can be stolen unless it was used
- If you choose to discard the card it gets discarded to your discard pile
