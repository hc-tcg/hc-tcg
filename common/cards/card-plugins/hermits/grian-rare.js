// The tricky part about this one are destroyable items (shield, gold_armor, totem) since they are available at the moment of attack, but not after
/*
// some assumptions that make sense to me:
- gold_armor/shield can't be stolen as they get used up during the attack
- if hermitMultiplier is 0 (e.g. invis potion), then shield/golden_armor don't get used and so you can steal them
- totem can be stolen unless it was used to keep opponent hermit alive
- if opponent hermits dies, his effect card can still be stolen
- If Grian dies while attacking (e.g. TNT), then item still get stolen
*/
/*
# Totem
- You can't steal totem during attack since you don't know yet if its gong to be used to revive
- You can't do it at actionEnd since the healthCheck wasn't performed yet
- You can't do it on actionStart since the gamestate was sent already
= You can't do it on actionsAvasilable because it is hard to tell in case of hermit's death it is hard to tell why were his items discarded
- Solution: Going back to using recovery effects during attack, which will enable using the actionEnd hook.
