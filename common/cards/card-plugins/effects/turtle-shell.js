/*
Questions:
- What to do when grian/emerald movees tutlrte shell to active hermit?
	- Should it active immediately or require the hermit to go afk and active again?
	- What about the hermit that got his shell stolen? Is he protected anyway or can he be damaged now?
*/

/*
Situations:
- Opponent has turtle_shell on him at start of turn
	- Players attacks (prevents damage -> tutrtle shell discarded)
	- Opponent is made afk (turtle shell discarded form now afk hermit)
	- Player just ends turn (turtle shell discarded)
- Opponent receives turtle shell through emerald
	- Same as above ^
- Opponent receives turtle shell through attack special move
	- Shouldn't be possible right now there is no special moves that put effect on opponent
*/

/*
Testing:
- Must work with hypno (effect not applied when attacking AFK)
- Must work with XB/URTFC/golden axe - tutrtle shell is ignored
- Must work with Zed's sheep stare (Zed's opponent should still receive damage either way)
