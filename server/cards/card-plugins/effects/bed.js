Info confirmed by beef:
- If knockback is used, sleeping opponent goes AFK but wakes up.
- Discarding/Stealing the bed does not effect the sleeping opponent.
- You can use single use effects while sleeping that don't cause any damage.
- Bed can be placed only on active hermit.
- You go to sleep the moment you place the bed down so technically you lose 3 turns of attacking.
